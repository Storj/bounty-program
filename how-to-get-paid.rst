How To Get Paid
===============

GPG Signatures
---------------

It’s our policy that any financial transactions submitted, must go through an extra layer of security to prevent phishing and scamming. We’ve added an additional layer of security to prevent this. One way to prove an identity is through Keybase via GPG signed messaging. Please follow the guide below to get setup. If you have additional questions, please reach out on `Rocket Chat`_ , specifically the #gpg-signature channel.

STEP 1: Navigate to the Keybase homepage
----------------------------------------

`Keybase`_ provides public keys that can be trusted without you having to talk to the person of interest. If you don't have an account, you can get started by creating a new account on the `Keybase homepage`_. Click on ``Login`` on the right side of the headers:

STEP 2: Join Keybase
--------------------

After you've clicked on the ``Login`` button, you should see this pop-up:

Click on ``Join Keybase``. 

STEP 3: Activate account
------------------------

Enter your email address, username (easiest to use your rocketchat alias), and choose a strong passphrase. Do not use create easy, hackable passwords like `123456`. After your information is entered, the screen should look something like this:

.. figure:: static/keybase-join.png

Click on ``Activate!``.

STEP 4: Add PGP key
--------------------

After you've clicked on the ``Activate!`` button, you should be navigated to a dashboard like this:

.. image:: static/keybase-dashboard.jpg

Click on ``add a PGP Key``.

STEP 5: Get public key
----------------------

You should get the following pop-up:

.. figure:: static/keybase-pgp-key.png

If you have a PGP key, you can enter it via the option ``I have one already``. In this tutorial, we assume you don’t have one and need a public key. Please click on ``I need a public key`` to proceed.

STEP 6: Generate public key
---------------------------

After you've clicked on ``I need a public key``, you should see this: 

.. figure:: static/keybase-generate-key.png

Click on ``Ok, got it``.

STEP 7: Add account(s) to have public key
------------------------------------------

Shortly after, you'll get a screen where you should enter your name and email address(es) you want to associate with your public key. After you've filled out the information, it should look like this:

.. figure:: static/keybase-add-account.png

Click on ``Let the math begin``.

STEP 8: Associate account(s) with public key
--------------------------------------------

After you've click, there is going to be some magic that happens in the background:

After a minute or so you'll see your public key:

.. figure:: static/keybase-done.png

Click on ``Done post to Keybase``.

STEP 9: Verify GitHub and Twitter
---------------------------------

You have successfully created a GPG Key and linked it to your account. The Dashboard should change to look like this:

.. figure:: static/keybase-final-dashboard.png

With this screen you’re finally able to send encrypted messages and have a public place to verify all your other accounts. Please get your `GitHub`_ and `Twitter`_ identity accounts approved.
